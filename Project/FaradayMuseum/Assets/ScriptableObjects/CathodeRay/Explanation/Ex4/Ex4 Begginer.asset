  title: Congratulations! You made a spiral!
  description: "I know, it doesn't really look like a spiral, but it is one.\r\n\r\nIt
    doesn't look like one since the radius is too big. The line continues. . If it
    was\r zoomed out, you would see it\u2019s forming a spiral.\r\n\r\nLet's make
    one more, with the following values: Rotation = 94\xBA, Intensity = 0,7 A, Tension
    = 100 V."
