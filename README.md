# IST-Thesis-FaradayMuseum

## WebGL Branch

It contains a WebGL version of the work done on the Cathode Ray artifact, which consists of an educational game about  it. This game can be played [here](http://web.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/~ist181633/FaradayMuseum/CathodeRay/).
This work can serve as the basis for an online version of the Faraday Museum or in Virtual Reality.
It allows to rotate the object and manipulate his values. Automatically saves the user interactions in a web server, for research reasons.
